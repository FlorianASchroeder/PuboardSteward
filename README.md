# PuboardSteward
An Android Point of Sale app for private and closed communities. 
It does not actually transfer money but keeps accounts like a tab but using NFC for identification.
Think of it as being a digital tab for Tablets using NFC.

The key ideas behind this project were
- Easy to manage - everything runs off a Google spreadsheet
- Easy to use - select items, swipe the card and transactions happen within 1-2 seconds
- Fast UI - Local caching of information to minimise response times
- Lightweight communication - Highly efficient usage of Google Cloud Messaging
- Secure - OAuth2 for spreadsheet connection
- Scalable - Works with any number of Devices
- Synchronised - Local cashes on all devices are updated simultaneously
